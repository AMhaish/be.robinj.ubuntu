# SHORT DESCRIPTION #
The Ubuntu Unity desktop on your Android device

# FULL DESCRIPTION #
-- Description --
Do you like Linux/Ubuntu? Does it seem awesome to you to be able to have the Unity desktop as your Android home screen? No? Ok, bye bye. In that case, this isn't for you.
This work in progress will allow you to have the Unity desktop running as your Android home/launcher screen.

-- Notice --
It's a Beta, so if something doesn't work, or you have a suggestion, please let me know. Don't go drilling a Beta into the ground with 1 star reviews without actually telling me why you didn't like it, like some people are doing. Nobody's going to benefit from that.
Feel free to leave bug reports and suggestions on Google+ (https://plus.google.com/communities/111207292310016778258) or Github (https://github.com/RobinJ1995/be.robinj.ubuntu/issues), or contact me by e-mail.
