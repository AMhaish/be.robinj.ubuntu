    <string name="option_colourcalc_hsv">Use HSV</string>

    <string name="hint_colourcalc_hsv">Using HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) instead of plain RGB (Red, Green, Blue) will result in colours being much more vibrant, but the calculations that are being preformed are more complicated which can result in longer loading times on slower devices.</string>

    <string name="option_dashsearch_full">Advanced Dash search</string>

    <string name="hint_dashsearch_full">Enabling this option will result in better Dash search results but will also affect performance on slower devices or devices with a lot of apps installed. If Dash search is slow for you, you might want to consider disabling this.</string>
