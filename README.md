Ubuntu Launcher
===============

Ubuntu Launcher is a home screen replacement for Android that resembles Ubuntu's Unity desktop. Currently the project is still in beta.

## Where can I get it?

The [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.robinj.ubuntu)

## How can I help?

If you speak a non-English language, and your knowledge of the English language and Ubuntu-specific terms is sufficient, then you can help out by translating the project into your language. This can be done [on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/ubuntu-launcher/).
If you want to help out and translate the project into a language that isn't listed yet, contact me at android-dev@robinj.be so I can add that language to the project.
